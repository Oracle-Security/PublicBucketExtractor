# PublicBucketExtractor
Extracts file paths based on your given parameters from public buckets. This uses Grayhat Warfares API so you will need to purchase VIP to use this script.

Usage:

doKeyword and doExtension should be set to true or false depending on what you want to do.
you will need to modify the code and add keywords, urlextensions, exclusions, etc etc... to fit your needs.
There is code put in to download the data from the file paths, however this generates an insane amount of data, I would not use it unless you have your search params very fine tuned.
